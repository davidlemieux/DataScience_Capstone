## Summary

The summary of the model illustrate the pros and cons of the methodology and propose further reaseach or customisation that can be applied to enhance the model.

*Pros*:
- Simple and Easy to understand
- Usage of sparse matrix without name is really light
- More than 1 choice to replicate what is used in the real life

*Cons*:
- Non adaptative : The model does not learn from actual user
- Can get pretty heavy in R due to the physical memory allocation
- More complexe than a "stupid" Algorithm


**Possible Improvement**
- To make the model faster if could be possible to remove from the matrix some rare words that use some memory.
- Implementing the "stupid" Algorithm could improve the speed of calculation but the user would lose its ability to have a more global choice


**Special Thanks**
Special Thanks to all the graders and teachers in this nice program. Keep up the good work and have a good Summer!
